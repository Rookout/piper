## Getting Started

Piper configures a webhook in git provider and listens to the webhooks sends. It will create a Workflow CRD out of branches that contains `.workflows` folder.
This folder should contain declarations of the templates and main DAG that will be running.
Finally, it will submit the Workflow as a K8s resource in the cluster.
To access more detailed explanations, please navigate to the [Documentation site](https://piper.rookout.com).
